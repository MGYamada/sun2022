<h2>Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations of SU(N) fermions in optical lattices</h2>

<p>Quantum many-body physics with large-hyperfine-spin ultracold fermions in optical lattices
    is at the cutting edge of ultracold atom physics and condensed matter physics.
    We have performed the large-scale sign-problem free quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations
    to study the half-filled lattice Hubbard models with SU(N) symmetry, exploring
    the high-symmetry states of matter in optical lattices loaded with large-hyperfine-spin ultracold fermions.
    We have investigated several models that are closely linked to cold atom experiments,
    including the SU(4) and SU(6) Hubbard models on both square and honeycomb lattices,
    the Ï€-flux SU(4) Hubbard model on a square lattice, the SU(4) Hubbard model on the square lattice
    with a staggered pattern of flux, and the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice.
    By the QMC simulation studies of these SU(N) Hubbard models, we have found novel states of matter
    with large-spin fermions in optical lattices, which are not accessible or stable in solids.
    In addition, we have studied numerically the quantum phase transitions and finite-temperature properties
    of these models.</p>
