<h2>Moments and multiplets in moiré materials</h2>

<p>The observation of strongly-correlated states in moiré systems has renewed the conceptual interest
    in magnetic systems with higher SU(4) spin symmetry, e.g. to describe Mott insulators where
    the local moments are coupled spin-valley degrees of freedom. In this talk, we will discuss
    the physics of a number of SU(4) spin-valley Hamiltonians relevant to moiré materials and
    make connections also to spin-orbit entangled Kugel-Khomskii models that bear a close resemblance
    and have a long history in the study of transition metal oxides. Technically,
    our calculations are based on a pseudo-fermion FRG approach, which has been expanded to tackle diagonal
    and off-diagonal couplings of generic spin-valley models in the self-conjugate representation
    of the SU(4) algebra.</p>
