<h2>Dynamics of ‘hadron' formation in repulsive non-equilibrium SU(n) Hubbard models</h2>

<p>We study post quench dynamics in the repulsive n-color Fermi-Hubbard model,
    initialized in a pattern of empty and n-times occupied sites. In any dimension and
    for any finite interaction, U>0, this state is proven to relax 
    to a negative temperature state. However, while for  weak interactions, U/J ≤ 1,
    a negative temperature Fermi liquid-like, weakly interacting state appears, for  U/J ≥ 1,
    quench spectroscopy as well as the behavior
    of time dependent correlation functions reveal the dynamical formation of heavy and
    strongly interacting composite particles. For n=3, in particular, most of the particles
    are bound to very heavy spinless 'baryons' (trions), strongly  interacting with
    a dilute background gas of intermediate mass mobile 'mesons' (doublons) and of light SU(3) fermions.
    Dynamical correlations reveal that Baryons move diffusively, with a motion generated
    by collisions with the mesonic background. Similarly rich negative temperature states form
    for any  n ≥ 2.</p>
