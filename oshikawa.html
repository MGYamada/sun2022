<h2>Anomaly and Ingappability of SU(N) systems</h2>

<p>In quantum field theory, a symmetry of the Lagrangian can be broken
upon quantization. This phenomenon, called anomaly, has many
significant implications in condensed matter physics.
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its generalizations can be also
understood as "ingappability" imposed by anomaly. I will discuss
LSM-type ingappabilities in SU(N) systems and their relation to anomaly.</p>
