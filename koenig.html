<h2>Quantum order in SU(N) impurity models</h2>

<p>Quantum order beyond Landau's paradigm is a paradigmatic concept for ultra quantum matter
    and topological error correction codes, alike. In full analogy to topological order
    in gapped systems, gapless quantum order is mathematically described by deconfining gauge theories
    and characterized by anyonic excitations in the system. In this talk, I will report on aspects
    of quantum order in frustrated SU(N) impurity systems. Specifically, I will exploit
    an exact mapping to demonstrate that for N≥4, a simple triangular Kondo-Heisenberg cluster
    impurity displays a topological phase and a trivial phase. Using controlled field theoretical methods
    in the large N limit, I will demonstrate that these phases are separated by a deconfinement transition
    which is driven by the proliferation of monopole-like gauge field excitations.
    Beyond the concrete application to impurity models, these controlled calculations help
    to conceptually understand analogous deconfinement transitions in 2D U(1) quantum spin liquids
    and fractionalized Fermi liquids.</p>
