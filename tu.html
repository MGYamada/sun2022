<h2>Collapsing Schrödinger’s cat: application of anyon eigenbasis in DMRG</h2>

<p>In two dimensions, topologically ordered phases defined on a nontrivial manifold
    have degenerate ground states protected by a gap. For such systems, it has been
    a nontrivial task to obtain the complete set of degenerate ground states in DMRG.
    In this talk I will discuss our recent progress on using anyon eigenbasis
    (also known as “minimally entangled states”) as the initialization ansatz in DMRG
    to obtain the complete set of degenerate ground states and characterize their topological order.</p>
