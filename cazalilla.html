<h2>Breaking SU(N) Symmetry in Alkaline-Earth-like Gases in and out of Equilibrium</h2>

<p>In this talk, I will briefly review some consequences of the breaking of the emergent 
    SU(N) symmetry [1] in models relevant to  Alkaline-earth-like gases like Ytterbium 173. 
    Beginning with our early study [2]  of the itinerant Ferromagnetism in these systems, 
    I will highlight the important differences  with the SU(2) case, and in particular the fact 
    that the transition is first order already at the mean-field level.  I will also discuss the 
    stability of Ferromagnetic initial  states in quantum quenches where the 
    strength and symmetry of the interaction is suddenly changed, and investigate 
    when and if a pre-thermalized regime exists [2]. Finally, time permitting I will 
    discuss the effects of breaking SU(N) symmetry by introducing artificial gauge fields
    in the kinetic energy in fermionic ladders. In these lattice systems, we have found a regime 
    where mean-field renormalized band structure is able to describe and predict 
    interaction induced topological Lifshitz transitions [4], which give rise to  cusps 
    in the orbital current  as a function of the flux per plaquette or the interaction strength.</p>
