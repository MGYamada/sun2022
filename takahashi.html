<h2>Quantum Magnetism of Cold-Atom SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard Model</h2>

<p>A system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice is an ideal quantum simulator of
    a strongly correlated quantum many-body system [1].
    Ultracold fermions with an enlarged spin symmetry of SU(N) offer novel possibilities
    of quantum simulation [2]. In particular, recent theories for an SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard
    model predict novel quantum magnetisms. I will present our study of an SU(N=6)
    Fermi-Hubbard model by working with ultracold two-electron atoms of ytterbium.
    By developing an all-optical means of singlet-triplet oscillation, we successfully detect
    nearest-neighbor spin correlations in various lattice geometries.
    Importantly, this enlarged spin symmetry of SU(N) is a powerful tool to lower
    the temperature of atoms in an optical lattice, known as a Pomeranchuk cooling effect.
    The detailed comparison between theory and experiment allows us to infer the realization
    of a lowest temperature of cold-atom Fermi-Hubbard model in one dimension [3].
    I will also present the experiments with a plaquette lattice configuration with
    various spin imbalances and intra- to inter-plaquette hopping ratios, including
    the realization of a novel four-body entangled state of SU(4)-singlet,
    and the quantum magnetism in an open dissipative Fermi-Hubbard system.</p>
