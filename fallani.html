<h2>Strongly interacting SU(N) fermions with coherent spin manipulation: flavour-dependent Mott localization and universal Hall response</h2>

<p>I will present the results of recent experiments performed with multicomponent 173Yb Fermi gases
    in optical lattices, in the presence of strong atom-atom interactions and coherent driving
    between different internal states.</p>

<p>I will discuss the realization of interacting SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard systems,
    where the addition of a coherent Raman coupling between different spin states is
    used to induce a controlled breaking of the SU(N) global interaction symmetry.
    This explicit symmetry-breaking action is shown to favour Mott localization and
    determines the onset of a flavour-selective behavior. I will discuss the experimental
    results and the connection with the physics of strongly correlated materials,
    where a similar orbital-selective behavior arises from the coupling of different electronic orbitals.</p>

<p>I will also discuss recent experiments where we have measured the Hall conductivity
    in interacting synthetic ladders obtained from a momentum-dependent Raman coupling,
    which simulates the presence of an external magnetic field for effectively charged particles.
    I will show a strong dependence of the Hall response upon changing atom-atom interactions
    and show the emergence of a universal regime in the strongly interacting limit.</p>
