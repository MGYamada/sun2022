<h2>New Kitaev spin liquid candidate materials: ruthenium trihalides RuX3 (X = Br, I) with honeycomb structure</h2>

<p>In this talk, we will present the successful synthesis of two new Kitaev spin liquid candidate materials,
    RuBr3[1] and RuI3[2], via the high-pressure method.
    We believe that these are New Kitaev spin liquid candidate materials like
    α-RuCl3 which is the most probable candidate material for the Kitaev quantum spin liquid.
    RuBr3 possesses an ideal honeycomb lattice of Ru3+ with R-3 symmetry and shows
    the antiferromagnetic order with zigzag-type magnetic structure at TN = 34 K.
    The moment angle from honeycomb plane in RuBr3 is larger than that in α-RuCl3,
    suggesting larger Kitaev interactions in RuBr3 compared to α-RuCl3. On the other hand,
    there are two kinds of polymorph in RuI3 with the honeycomb lattice; R-3 and P-31c.
    RuI3 with the honeycomb structure shows a semi-metallic feature in the electrical resistivity
    and no magnetic order down to the lowest measurement temperature.  Metal-insulator transition
    occurs by an introduction of iodine for halogen site X in RuX3. In our presentation,
    we will show an electronic phase diagram of RuX3 and discuss the effect of bandwidth control
    in Ruthenium trihalides.</p>
