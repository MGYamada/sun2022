<h2>Rigorous Results for Lattice Fermion Models with SU(N) Symmetry</h2>

<p>Recent advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to simulate multicomponent fermions
    with ultracold atoms. In particular, N-component fermions with SU(N) symmetry in optical lattices
    have attracted much attention because they are predicted to exhibit various exotic phases that
    do not appear in the SU(2) counterpart. These systems are well described by the SU(N) Hubbard model,
    but this model is notoriously difficult to analyze mathematically and new theoretical tools must
    be developed.</p>

<p>In this talk, I would like to present rigorous results for (i) the ground states
    of the attractive SU(N) Hubbard model [1] and (ii) N-body clustering eigenstates
    of the extended SU(N) Hubbard chain [2]. For (i), I present the results in the form
    of theorems on the degeneracy, the SU(N) quantum number, and the long-range order
    of the ground states. To prove the theorems, I make full use of a newly developed method
    of Majorana reflection positivity, inspired by recent progress in the sign-problem-free
    quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For (ii), we generalize Î·-pairing states, which are
    exact eigenstates of the SU(2) Hubbard model. When N is even, these states exhibit
    off-diagonal long-range order in N-particle reduced density matrix. On the other hand,
    when N is odd, the correlations decay exponentially with distance in the bulk, but
    end-to-end correlations do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit.</p>
